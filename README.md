# ESC Group CCR Handbook

"Also, since you are the first student to use CCR in our lab, please develop a 'handbook' for using CCR. In this handbook, you can overview the resources in CCR and how to make a quick start. Then, you can structure an outline Q&A section and list the common questions and troubleshooting solutions." 

In this handbook, I will provide an overview of the resources in CCR and how to make a quick start. Then, I will structure an outline Q&A section and list the common questions and troubleshooting solutions.

## What is CCR?
“The Center for Computational Research (CCR) at the University at Buffalo is a high-performance research computing center offering faculty, staff, students, and local businesses access to supercomputing environments, high-end visualization services, an on-premise research cloud infrastructure, and experienced staff to help you move your research forward.” (source: https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/) 

*TLDR: CCR is a high-performance research computing center at the University at Buffalo. We will use the computing nodes CCR offers to run our programs, store data, and collaborate on projects.*

## What resources does CCR offer?
 
CCR offers a variety of resources, but only HPC Clusters and Project Storage are important to us.
