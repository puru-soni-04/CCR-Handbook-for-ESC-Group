## Can I Visual Studio Code on CCR Compute Nodes?
Yes, but only when VSCode is launched through the [OnDemand Portal](README.md#ondemand-portal). CCR does not support custom VSCode server.

## I get an error when starting Jobs though the OnDemand Portal. What should I do?
Yeah, the OnDemand Portal sucks. Please [submit/start jobs though terminal](README.md#run-jobs--access-the-nodes).

## My Jobs Keep Crashing. What do I do?
Please review the output file of the job. If you can't figure out what's going wrong, start a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/puru-soni-04/ESC-Group-CCR-Handbook/issues/new)

> **Note**: It's likely due to filled up user storage space. Move large files to `/projects/academic/wenyaoxu/`.
